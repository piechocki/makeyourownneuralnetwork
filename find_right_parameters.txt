inputnodes:     number of unique input information (e.g. number of pixels of
                an image)
hiddennodes:    should be between inputnodes and outputnodes, but duration of
                calculation rises with a high number of hidden nodes
outputnodes:    number of possible outputs (number of true unique categories)
learning_rate:  not to high (overshooting) and not to low (doesn't reach the
                minimum of error function), but can be lower with a higher
                number of epochs (iterations) and viceversa
epochs:         not to high (overfitting) and not to low (doesn't reach the
                minimum of error function = underfitting), but can be higher
                with a lower alpha and viceversa
scaled_input:   -1 < x < 1 (can be different to this range if another
                activation function is chosen)
output:         returns 0 < y < 1 for every x (the exact borders and the
                distribution of y depends on the chosen activation function)
weights:        starting values of weight matrices should be filled with
                random numbers x with -1/sq.root(z) <= x <= 1/sq.root(z)
                and with z = number of outgoing nodes of this matrix
